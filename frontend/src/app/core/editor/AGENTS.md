# Markdown Editor Instructions

These rules apply to every file under `frontend/src/app/core/editor/`.

## Architecture

- Markdown source is the canonical document. Editor presentation, preview, uploads, and commands
  must not create a second content model or silently rewrite unrelated source.
- Keep Editor, Source, and Preview as modes of one editor integration. Preserve the same document,
  selection, history, unsaved value, and upload anchors when changing modes or fullscreen state.
- Build on direct modular CodeMirror 6 packages and public extension points. Do not depend on copied
  internals, an Angular CodeMirror wrapper, `basicSetup`, or raw mutation of CodeMirror-owned DOM.
- Keep the Angular component focused on browser lifecycle, accessibility, i18n, CSP boundaries,
  uploads, and integration. Put commands, Markdown semantics, presentation, and table behavior in
  cohesive Angular-independent modules.
- Apply local edits as minimal CodeMirror transactions so undo/redo, selections, history, parser
  state, and scroll intent remain correct. Replace the whole document only for a genuinely changed
  external input and keep that synchronization out of user undo history.

## Markdown and Rendering Contracts

- Derive syntax-aware presentation from the CodeMirror syntax tree and viewport-aware extensions.
  Add a new syntax feature through the shared parser, command, highlighting, and preview contracts
  that actually need it; do not add a parallel parser or an unrelated language registry.
- Heading commands must produce valid ATX headings at the requested level, operate consistently on
  every selected line, and toggle the same heading level without damaging the selected text.
- Link commands must preserve valid escaped Markdown. Typed wiki links must keep their typed target
  and optional label semantics and resolve to localized internal routes through the shared wiki-link
  contracts.
- Image paste, drop, and picker flows must be available only when uploads are enabled. Preserve the
  captured insertion position and stable file order, expose upload failures, and let private-content
  consumers disable inline images rather than bypassing their protected-file workflow.
- Render preview only through the centralized sanitized renderer. Preserve wiki-link handling and
  shared syntax highlighting, and keep regression tests for scripts, event-handler attributes, and
  unsafe URL schemes whenever rendering or sanitization changes.
- Keep table behavior as a Markdown editing extension: source remains real Markdown, edits remain
  undoable, malformed input stays editable, and keyboard, pointer, clipboard, selection, and
  adjacent-prose behavior remain accessible and deterministic.

## Security, Browser Lifecycle, and Styling

- Keep CodeMirror setup, DOM access, storage, timers, clipboard, downloads, uploads, focus
  management, geometry, and other browser-only capabilities inside lifecycle-aware code using
  injected platform/document abstractions; do not access browser globals at module scope.
- Pass Angular's CSP nonce to CodeMirror's supported nonce configuration. Keep compiled editor styles
  component-scoped and lazy; do not introduce runtime inline positioning, copied CodeMirror base
  styles, broader CSP sources, or global editor theme imports.
- Preserve accessible names, focus restoration, keyboard-trap escape, IME composition, native
  platform navigation/undo, readable selection/caret states, and reduced interference with browser
  input behavior.

## Testing and Verification

- For editor fixes, reproduce the regression at the relevant public contract when practical.
  Follow the repository verification policy rather than imposing a separate TDD workflow.
- Cover changed critical editor/Markdown behavior at the affected modes, input methods,
  selection/undo boundaries, and malformed-input cases. Avoid unrelated coverage expansion.
- Test observable contracts through public CodeMirror state, transactions, commands, events, stable
  semantic classes, and rendered output. Do not assert private helper names, source text, arbitrary
  DOM nesting, or other implementation details.
- Do not weaken, delete, skip, or narrow an existing regression test merely to accept a new
  implementation. When the product contract intentionally changes, state the change and replace the
  old expectation with coverage for the new contract and the previous regression boundary.
- JSDOM does not verify geometry, scrolling, selection/caret rendering, font metrics, clipboard
  permissions, or all IME behavior. Check affected contracts in the available real browser. If a
  required interaction cannot be automated or accessed, report the remaining gap and request only
  that specific manual check; do not claim it was verified.
- Run focused editor suites and the applicable frontend Make checks for the changed contract.
  Include accessibility, CSP, timing, and browser/SSR boundaries where relevant.
